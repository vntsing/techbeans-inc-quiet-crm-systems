# CRM Structure & Schema

The CRM template tracks contacts across several categories:

- Sponsors / Brand Deals
- Podcast Guests / Interviewees
- Collaborators (designers, editors, assistants)
- Donors / Investors
- Mentors / High-value relationships

Each entry includes:

- Name + Role
- Category (Sponsor, Guest, etc)
- Stage (Prospect, Confirmed, Delivered, Paid)
- Email + Social links
- Notes & Next Steps
- Related documents or pitch decks

The system is filterable by type or status, so you can see:
- Who needs a follow-up
- Which guests are booked
- Whoâ€™s overdue for payment
